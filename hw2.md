# Digital Economy: World Impact

According to New Digital Estimates, just in the United States, the digital economy accounted for 9 percent of the current dollar gross domestic product, when compared with traditional U.S. industries or sectors, the digital economy ranked below the manufacturing sector and above the finance sector, the rate of growth of the digital economy in yearly average is 6.8 compared to the 1.7 of the overall economy [1]. This data shows a clear view of how the digital economy is growing every year, this sector is demanding more workers with high technical skills and different from more traditional sectors as the manufacturing and the construction.

The way of how to measure the advancement of the digital economy in the developed and emerging countries is based in the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) Indicators. The ICT indicators are for example the access lines per 100 inhabitants, mobile subscription per 100 inhabitants or the broadband subscriptions [2], this data gives the insight of how the digital economy is takin place and is growing specially in the emerging countries such as in Latin America and southeast Asia

The traditional business models are busines to consumer, business to business, consumer to business and consumer to consumer, but in the digital economy the use of internet and the social media have become an advantage for those small and medium enterprises to sell their products as it is for example the person that sells its products on Facebook or the restaurant that can found in Google maps, and the bigger companies that drive their growth using data to increase its revenue. [4]

As it is mentioned previously the use of data in the companies gives insight about the market and what kind of strategies to follow. Strategic Data Analysis is a process to follow to understand the market, the use of statistical and information technologies helps the individuals to perform the strategic data analysis. [2] Data is what makes the difference in the decision-making process, and its use gives a company an advantage to other different companies.

The ICT has increased the business productivity and revenue, and with this the investment in Information and Communication Technologies especially in the innovation of more technology and software which gives an advantage to the company, to grant protection to their inventions the patents play an important role for the industry, the patents provide security and at the same time revenue for those who want to have access to the technology, the IT lawyers have become an important role inside the companies. [2]

The ICT and the Digital Economy has impacted in other areas such as in the telecommunication sector, the fast speed internet is now the standard for the communication worldwide, other impact is the health sector from storing the data of the patients in databases to the use of robots to perform surgeries. In the agriculture sector, the impact is important since the greater demand for food has driven the use of technology such as forecasting, automated watering and threat prevention. In other sectors such as the science has speed up the research and share of knowledge which is the case for the record time to create a vaccine for COVID-19, in the case of the energetic sector the IoT devices have become more energy efficient.

It is mentioned that the use of the ICT indicators are used to compare the progress made by the countries in terms of technology and communication, these indicators are as well used to measure the progress of the digital economy, for example the connectivity, in this particular case some examples are the broadband per households, the access to mobile internet per 100 inhabitants, etc. but others are different such as the human capital, in other words the people that know how to use the internet, the digital public services, which is the work by the government and this has evolve fast especially in the largest cities, other index is the use of internet, for example in services and online transactions.

1. Do you consider that the use of patents is good? Why?

I consider it is good to protect the innovation of the creators, and makes the innovation competitive, but at the same time it has its drawbacks, because with the use of patents this creates a bottleneck for the democratization of technology, which is the case for developing countries and individuals that do not have the money to pay for the patents.

2. What is the most important ICT indicator in your consideration?

I consider that the internet connections per 100 inhabitants is the most important, because this gives an insight of how a region is connected to the rest of the world, the internet is responsible to the access of information and social media.

 3. Do you think there is a disadvantage of the digital economy in emerging markets?

I think there is an important disadvantage because the inequality between countries makes it harder to implement policies to make sure that everyone has internet or access to technology if the first needs are not satisfied.

4.  Would the increase of ICT in different areas would lead to unemployment?

There would be a shift in the demand of the kind of skills required by the industry, while some profession would no longer be necessary in the future, there would be a lack of professional who would be required to satisfy the needs. The jobs available would transform.

5.  What is the area you think has more impact of ICT?

E-commerce is the area with the grated impact, because in the previous years, people used to buy everything at the physical store, and this is something that is changing especially for those who are used to the technology and the internet navigation.

6. Do you agree that the record time of the vaccine for COVID-19 is due principally by the ICT?

Yes, I agree, because the share of knowledge between scientist around the world would not be possible without the use of the current forms of communication, the information about the virus become of easy access.

7. What you consider is the main responsibility of the government in case of the Digital Economy?

I think that the responsibility of the government is to ensure the access of internet and also to allow the citizens to be able to access the public services online and be more present in the online platforms where the citizens usually spent more time.

8. The use of data is the main fuel of the 4th industrial revolution, how can it impact the Digital Economy?

The competence between large companies has made that the quality and quantity of data they required as an important asset to take advantage in the market, the data would automatize even more things that are already part of our life.

9. There is an unequal distribution of jobs between women and men in ICT, how would you handle this difference?

This can be addressed at the primary education, specially that the STEM area is not for only one gender, it is universal, the early access to the technology in girls contributes to more equal opportunities.

10.  What would you do to participate more in the global trends of the digital economy?

I would suggest get information about the trends of technology and start applying to our daily life, digital economy is here to stay as eases our lifestyle, some people would require help to understand how to make a transaction or accessing online banking, the help specially of the younger generations to the older is crucial
